# Live Concert Recordings and Setlists Repository  
Created by Cooper Irwin  
INFO 4730 Project – Digital Curation & Preservation  

## Overview
This repository preserves and organizes a curated selection of historically significant live concert performances and their setlists. It applies core digital curation principles—structured metadata, provenance tracking, version control, and sustainability—to ensure that these materials remain accessible and interpretable for researchers, educators, fans, and music historians.

This repository includes:
- Five curated concerts (metadata + setlists + documentation)
- A centralized Dublin-Core–inspired metadata file (`metadata/metadata.csv`)
- Artist → Concert folder hierarchy
- Clear rights statements and provenance for each item  
- A preservation-minded structure using open formats (CSV, MD)

## Purpose
The goal is to support long-term preservation and scholarly access to live performance information by:
- Documenting authenticity and provenance  
- Standardizing descriptive metadata  
- Providing stable, citable GitHub URLs  
- Offering an accessible, searchable structure
