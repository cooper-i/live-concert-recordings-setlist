# Metadata

This directory stores shared metadata resources for the Live Concert Recordings and Setlists Repository.

Typical contents:

- CSV or JSON files used for repository ingest
- Controlled vocabularies for venues, tours, formats, and rights statements
- Documentation for field definitions (e.g., Dublin Core mappings)
- Examples of standardized metadata records for performances and recordings

These files support consistency across artist and performance folders and enable long-term preservation, discovery, and interoperability.
